      When faced with unclear or ambiguous instructions:
      
      1. STOP work immediately
      2. Do NOT make assumptions about what the user wants
      3. Ask a specific clarifying question about the ambiguous part
      4. Wait for the user's response before proceeding
      5. Only implement changes after receiving clear direction
      
      This applies especially to:
      - Instructions with multiple possible interpretations
      - Requests that could be implemented in different ways
      - Vague terms like "improve", "fix", or "make better"
      - Spatial or visual instructions (e.g., "move this up a bit")
      - Any instruction where you're not 100% certain of the intent
