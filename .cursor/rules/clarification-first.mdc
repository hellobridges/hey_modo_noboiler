      When faced with unclear or ambiguous instructions:
      
      1. STOP work immediately
      2. Do NOT make assumptions about what the user wants
      3. Ask a specific clarifying question about the ambiguous part
      4. Wait for the user's response before proceeding
      5. Only implement changes after receiving clear direction
      
      This applies especially to:
      - Instructions with multiple possible interpretations
      - Requests that could be implemented in different ways
      - Vague terms like "improve", "fix", or "make better"
      - Spatial or visual instructions (e.g., "move this up a bit")
      - Any instruction where you're not 100% certain of the intent

examples:
  - input: |
      # Unclear instruction
      "Make the navigation bar more compact"
      
      # Proper response
      "I'm not sure if you want to reduce the vertical height of the navigation bar, 
      decrease the horizontal spacing between items, or make the text smaller. 
      Could you please clarify which aspect of the navigation bar you'd like to compact?"
    output: "Asking for clarification before making changes"
