      Add a placeholder file to empty directories for Git tracking:
      
      - `.gitkeep`: `New-Item -Path "[directory_path]/.gitkeep" -ItemType File -Force`
      - README.md: `Set-Content -Path "[directory_path]/README.md" -Value "# Purpose of this directory"`
      
      Git doesn't track empty directories by default.
