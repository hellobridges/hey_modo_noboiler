      # Android-First Testing Guidelines

      ## Default Testing Platform
      - Use Android as the default platform for testing Flutter applications
      - Run tests with: `flutter run -d android` or specify a specific Android device

      ## Error Handling Protocol
      - If Android environment is not available:
        1. STOP testing immediately
        2. Report to the user that Android environment is not available
        3. Do not proceed with alternative platforms without user approval
      
      - If compilation errors occur:
        1. STOP testing immediately
        2. Report compilation errors to the user
        3. Do not attempt to fix errors without understanding their root cause
        4. Wait for user guidance before proceeding

      ## Platform-Specific Testing
      - Only test on iOS, web, or desktop when:
        1. Explicitly requested by the user
        2. Testing platform-specific features
        3. Verifying cross-platform compatibility after Android testing is successful

      ## Testing Verification
      - Verify that the app launches successfully on Android
      - Confirm that UI renders correctly on Android screen sizes
      - Test core functionality on Android before other platforms
      - Document any Android-specific issues encountered

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Testing on non-default platform without justification
      flutter run -d chrome
      
      # Good: Android-first testing approach
      # Test objective: Verify bottom navigation functionality on Android
      flutter run -d android
      
      # If Android environment is not available:
      # STOP and notify user: "Android environment not available. Please set up an Android emulator or connect a device."
    output: "Android-first testing approach with proper error handling"
